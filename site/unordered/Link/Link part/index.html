        The physical setup includes a medium to high value (100 kilohm - 50 megohm) resistor between the send pin and 
        the receive (sensor) pin. The receive pin is the sensor terminal. A wire connected to this pin with a piece of
        foil at the end makes a good sensor. For many applications, a more useful range of values is obtained if the 
        sensor is covered with paper, plastic, or another insulating material, so that users do not actually touch the 
        metal foil. Research has shown that a small capacitor (100 pF) or so from sensor pin to ground improves stability
        and repeatability.
